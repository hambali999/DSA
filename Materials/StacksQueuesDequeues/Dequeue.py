# A deque, also known as a double-ended queue, is an ordered collection of items similar to the queue. 
# It has two ends, a front and a rear, and the items remain positioned in the collection. 
# What makes a deque different is the unrestrictive nature of adding and removing items. 
# New items can be added at either the front or the rear. Likewise, existing items can be removed from either end. 
# In a sense, this hybrid linear structure provides all the capabilities of stacks and queues in a single data structure.

# It is important to note that even though the deque can assume many of the characteristics of stacks and queues, 
# it does not require the LIFO and FIFO orderings that are enforced by those data structures. 
# It is up to you to make consistent use of the addition and removal operations.


# Methods and AttributesÂ¶
# Deque() creates a new deque that is empty. It needs no parameters and returns an empty deque.
# addFront(item) adds a new item to the front of the deque. It needs the item and returns nothing.
# addRear(item) adds a new item to the rear of the deque. It needs the item and returns nothing.
# removeFront() removes the front item from the deque. It needs no parameters and returns the item. The deque is modified.
# removeRear() removes the rear item from the deque. It needs no parameters and returns the item. The deque is modified.
# isEmpty() tests to see whether the deque is empty. It needs no parameters and returns a boolean value.
# size() returns the number of items in the deque. It needs no parameters and returns an integer.
