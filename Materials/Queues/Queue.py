# A queue is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items happens at one end, called the “rear,” 
# and the removal of existing items occurs at the other end, commonly called the “front.” 
# As an element enters the queue it starts at the rear and makes its way toward the front, waiting until that time when it is the next element to be removed.

# The most recently added item in the queue must wait at the end of the collection. 
# The item that has been in the collection the longest is at the front. 
# This ordering principle is sometimes called FIFO, first-in first-out. It is also known as “first-come first-served.”

# The simplest example of a queue is the typical line that we all participate in from time to time. 
# We wait in a line for a movie, we wait in the check-out line at a grocery store, and we wait in the cafeteria line. 
# The first person in that line is also the first person to get serviced/helped.

# Let's see a diagram which shows this and compares it to the Stack Data Structure

#FIFO, First In, First Out
